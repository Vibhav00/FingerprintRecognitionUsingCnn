## About ü§ó

This is <b>static</b> fingerprint recogination application üñ• where the model is trainded in the backend using cnn üíª i.e <i>Convolutional Neural Network</i>and front end is in html,css , and javascript . the json api is build using flask server and deep learning model .

The poject is basically focused on the machine learning part where we can visualize the output after passing through each convolution and pooling . if we provide a single fingerprint image then after passing through each layer how the image is changing we can see in this project .

## Diagram of the model üíé

## After passing through each layer the image changes as follows : üõ¥

### Step 1. This Image is passed to Model for Checking

<img src = "./images/testImage.png" width="400px"/>

this is the image with 103 X 96 px

<br>
<br>
### Step 2. After passing through first Convolutional layer we get this output

<img src = "./images/10194.png" width="400px"/>

since there are 64 filters with 3x3 each so the total images created is 64 and size reduced to 101 X 94 px i.e (103-(3-1),96-(3-1))

<br>
<br>

### Step 3. After passing through polling layer we get this

<img src = "./images/5047.png" width="400px"/>

after passing through polling layer we get 64 images with 50 X 47 px each . pool filter is of 2x2 so the size = (101/2,94/2) max among two pixes . so size reduced to half .

<br>
<br>

### Step 4. After passing through the second convolutional layer we get

<img src = "./images/4845.png" width="400px"/>

since there are 64 filters with 3x3 each so the total imgages created is 64 and size reduced to 48 X 45 px

<br>
<br>

### Step 5 . After passing through polling layer we get this

<img src = "./images/2422.png" width="400px"/>

fter passing through polling layer we get 64 images with 24 X 22 px each

<br>
<br>

### Step 6 . After passing through third convolution layer we get

<img src = "./images/2220.png" width="400px"/>

since there are 64 filters with 3x3 each so the total imgages created is 64 and size reduced to 22 X 20 px

<br>
<br>

### Step 7 . flatten the pixels and ploted in bar graph

<img src = "./images/2800.png" width="400px"/>

since there are 64 images with 22 X 20 px . so total number of input dat will be 22X20X64 = 28160

<br>
<br>

### Step 8 . Now it comes under dense layer with 64 neurons

<img src = "./images/64.png" width="400px"/>

we can see what different neurons calculate their output using relu activation function

<br>
<br>

### Step 9. Now it comes under dense layer with 51 neurons

<img src = "./images/51.png" width="400px"/>

these neurons are calcuting their output through the sigmoid function so the output comes under both region . (+ve and -ve )

<br>
<br>

### Step 10. Max among all the outputs

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src = "./images/35max.png"/></td> 
    <td><img src = "./images/final.png"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>
<br>

since we can see that the maximum output is for <b>35<b> so the fingerprint is corresponding to 35th person.
